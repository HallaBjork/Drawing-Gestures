### Project

A example sketch taken from the p5 site, with the boiler plate code for Learner.js included to take input from the MobileNet camera feature extractor. Your task is to use a classifier with at least 6 classes to make an interactive sketch controlled by the model. We have programmed the sketch to respond to the first 4 classes, it is up to you to edit the sketch to add in 2 more behaviours. You may also edit the 4 default mappings if you like, or switch to using a regression model if you would like to make continuous mappings (in which case you should use a minimum of 6 outputs).
